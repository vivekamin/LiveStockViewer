This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Problem
Create a service that allows for a user to search for stock name. On a successful search It will add current stock price to list.The user can add and remove as many stocks as he likes to add. The Graph and list will show a live price change for all stocks.

## Solution
Developed Angular application to consume IEX Trading RESTful API. Deployed application on heroku using express.js as dependency.
